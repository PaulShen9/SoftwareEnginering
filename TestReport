This is Paul Shen's test report.

First, I have to mentioned that I am still working on the three function so there is no test for
them.

I used the sample on the website to build my test script.
I find an issue is that the output file does not contain all the information I want. So, I
   changed the climite to a huge number in order to get full output

I use a varriable called count to check how many fail cases are there and the script will output
it at the end of the test.
