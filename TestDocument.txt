This is Paul Shen's test document file. This file include the idea of the test cases, the location of the test cases and how to run the test cases.

========================================================================================
Part 1: Valid command Test

How to run the test cases.

There is a script called test.sh in the floder and this script will put all the test result into test/output floder.
